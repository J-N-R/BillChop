# Description:
#    Server Program for BillChop.
#    Acts as a server that people's data can connect to.
#    
#    Each user will send what they want to buy here; eggs $3, drink $4, etc
#    and the server will sum it up and print out final results once everyone has set their data.
#
#    All results will be printed in JSON, including errors

# import stuff for server, if needed we can install something

# accept incoming connections (there will need to be a client.py that accepts cgi and connects to server)

# be able to sum up a client's chosen options
